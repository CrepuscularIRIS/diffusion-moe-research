## 0. Current research state (read this first)
- **★ ACTIVE — AMBITION-ANCHORED goal (produce ONE 一区-grade contribution — Information Fusion / ESWA;
  DIRECTION self-selected by research-os).** The goal (`plan/goal-directive.md`) no longer prescribes a hard
  core: the human sets the **AMBITION + a VALUE BAR** (a genuine contribution, and after a refutation a
  **PROGRESSIVE problemshift — never a retreat to the safest publishable thing**), and `research-os` v0.8
  `/prospect`→`/forge`→… selects the topic / idea / direction / TYPE **autonomously**. The human redirects
  from REPORTS; it does not hand-write the direction (do-not-ask-which-direction stays in force).
- **Current in-flight campaign = VLA robustness** on the built platform (**StarVLA** frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B +
  FAST + LoRA + **LIBERO-Plus**, 2×4090D; CYCLE-0 PASSED). **State (2026-07-03): the cross-stream-mechanism
  region is CLOSED.** CN-SRA (cross-stream restoration adapter) was BUILT end-to-end + cleanly **KILLED**
  (sealed verdict R_D=0.17, margin-vs-intra≈0, and the shuffled-sibling control recovered MORE, 0.229>0.171 →
  the cross-stream signal is CONFOUNDED, not real) — the 2nd refutation on this line (shared root cause = **no
  cross-stream redundancy** on this platform; every stream necessary). `/compass` = **LATERAL**. `/prospect`
  (Pro) returned 6 ranked directions ("predict-before-build repair selection"); the on-platform candidate =
  **Card-1 repair-compiler** (needs no acquisition, tests the predict-before-build claim directly), with
  active-acquisition (Card-2) HELD for a transplant domain (LIBERO-Plus corruptions are deterministic → cannot
  be re-observed). A Pro `/forge` of Card-2 was routed just before the pause — pull + reconcile against that
  feasibility fact. **VLA is the current vehicle, NOT a mandate** — `/prospect` may go LATERAL / leave VLA,
  carrying as priors the built platform + the load-once eval harness + the VALIDATED recoverability screen +
  the own-anomaly ledger {no-cross-stream-redundancy, shuffle>matched confound}. Design =
  `VLA/attribution-pivot-design-2026-07-02.md`; refs = `VLA/research-directions-2026-07-01.md` (SUPERSEDED) ·
  `VLA/platform-setup.md`, plus `/forge`'s `frames.md` + `taste-operators.md` (the `recoverability-gated-fusion`
  operator). The anti-retreat guard lives in the goal's VALUE BAR.
- **CLOSED / PAUSED (do NOT cross-contaminate):** DSpark × speculative decoding (warm-start RSMH; the
  beyond-Markov head space is largely exhausted — `DSpark-analysis.md`, `plan/dspark-deep-analysis-*`) AND
  the entire dLLM/DiffusionGemma/LLaDA campaign (archived `plan/archive/`, Arbor tree 5.1-5.13 done/pruned).
  Both are SEPARATE, non-active projects.

## 1. Engine stack — the division of labor (Opus 4.8 · GPT-5.5 Pro · Codex hook)
> **One line — Pro generates · Opus operates · Codex checks · human sets taste.** GPT-5.5 Pro is the
> DEFAULT engine for the GENERATIVE acts (idea/problem generation in /prospect, approach+head DESIGN in
> /forge, failure→next-candidate in /autopsy) — a different model reaches the enrich-level reframe a local
> checklist misses; skipping Pro on a generative act needs a stated reason, and Pro is NOT used for
> tactical iteration. Opus OPERATES: routes, packages the Pro hand-off, runs the mechanical moves
> (/prereg, /exp-verify), TUNES what Pro designed, decides tactically, interprets, AND is the executor
> (subagents inherit the session model = Opus 4.8). The **Codex review hook** auto-audits every executor
> diff (DOWN-only). The human grants contribution promotion — most valuable EARLY (shaping problems at
> /prospect · /forge), not only at sign-off. Manual `/codex:rescue` is **RETIRED**.

| Engine | How to invoke | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Opus 4.8 (me)** | direct (main loop) | **PI / decision-owner / interpreter.** OBSERVE, `/prospect`, `/forge`, SELECT/DECIDE, assemble+package the Pro hand-off, `/autopsy`, `/compass`, update tree/RUNLOG. **Never self-grants `CLAIM_STANDS`.** Prefer Opus high; reserve xhigh for the hardest judgment. |
| **Opus 4.8 executor subagents** | `Agent` (+ `isolation: "worktree"` when mutating files); inherits session model | **ALL implementation / experiment plumbing / verification runs / repo exploration / debug** (effort high default; xhigh for a hard bug). Returns changed-files + commands + test-results + artifact-paths + known-risks. Does NOT judge worth, grant a PASS, touch a sealed holdout, or rewrite the thesis. |
| **GPT-5.5 Pro** | Playwright `browser_*`; model button = **`Pro 扩展` (the ONLY tier — never switch)** | **External brain — DESIGNS each new candidate architecture by DEFAULT** (the `/forge` step-7 flip: Pro designs, Opus only tunes; skipping Pro needs a written reason — "optional" Pro = never-used Pro = the better design path thrown away). Also: prior-art / occupancy reads, contested `/adversary` passes, AC meta-review. Compact Opus-packaged hand-off (never a repo dump). 1h+; **poll 15 min**; **new chat per query**; **keep Playwright alive — never close/restart**. |
| **Codex review hook** | AUTOMATIC (SubagentStop; `CODEX_REVIEW_GATE_GLOBAL=true`) | **Independent adversarial review of EVERY executor subagent's diff** — SPARK inline (`gpt-5.3-codex-spark`, fast triage) + DEEP background (`gpt-5.5 xhigh`, read-only), advisory / non-blocking, surfaced via `systemMessage`. An uncurated, un-re-rollable independent substrate. A finding = a **binding DOWN** verdict; it **never grants UP** (silence ≠ pass). |
| **Human** | HARD-BLOCK escalation + EARLY problem-shaping | Contribution / paper / "architecture-advantage" promotion; critic↔proposer deadlock; flagship go/no-go; writes the goals. RARE at the back of the loop — most valuable at the front. |

## 2. The Arbor MCP — what we keep, what we dropped
Arbor offers two layers; we use only the first.
1. **MCP TOOL layer (KEEP — deterministic, immediately usable):** `tree_view` · `tree_add_node` ·
   `tree_update_node` · `tree_prune` · `tree_set_meta` · `worktree_create`/`worktree_remove` · `eval_run` ·
   `git_merge_branch` · `generate_report` · `open_dashboard`.
2. **`arbor-cycle` / `/arbor-research-agent` SKILL loop — DEPRECATED** (goal mode works better; user decision).
   Do not run it. The init scaffolding it left (`QUEUE.md`, `cycle-state.json`, `BLOCKED.md`, `review_debt.md`)
   is **vestigial** — ignore/archive.
- **Policy:** GOAL mode is the driver. The **Arbor MCP idea tree is the canonical research STRUCTURE**
  (`.arbor/sessions/<run>/.coordinator/idea_tree.json`). Maintain it at **every 验收 (tree FIRST,
  then RUNLOG)**. Use `worktree_create`/`eval_run`/`git_merge_branch`/`generate_report` opportunistically.
- **★ GOAL = a CONTINUOUS loop, not one stage.** `/prospect` → `/forge` → `/prereg` → run → `/exp-verify` →
  (claim → `/adversary` · null → `/autopsy`) → loop; `/compass` **after every 2nd `/autopsy`** (the countable
  trigger — "every 3–5 cycles" never fired in the DSpark campaign; §5.2). **★ THE ANTI-EXHAUSTION
  RULE (why past campaigns "kept stopping"): the backlog is ALIVE, never a menu.** Every `/autopsy` MUST
  emit its conversion-law output (a constraint, a new/reshaped candidate, or an explicit region-close that
  triggers a lateral `/prospect`). A null result is a per-cycle WIN **only if it generated something** —
  banking a negative that reshapes nothing is an incomplete autopsy, and halting after banking is the #1
  loop bug. **The loop picks its pivots itself by taste and NEVER stops to ask the user which direction.**
  A contribution/paper/"publishable" claim is **NOT** an autonomous loop outcome — it HARD-BLOCKS to
  human/external (§5.1); the loop only banks evidence and advances. Never end the session at "shortlist
  ready" or "one experiment done"; continue to the next live candidate. **Concrete caps (bounded
  autonomy):** ≤12 dispatched cycles/session; ≤3 consecutive inconclusive leads → stop+report; each experiment
  pre-declares a wall-clock budget (≤3h dev / ≤12h sealed), `kill -9` on overrun OR >30min zero-output.
  Otherwise the RUN stops ONLY when: a claim clears `/adversary` and reaches the promotion gate (→
  human/external); OR `/compass` says STOP_AND_REPORT (programme degenerated / caps); OR genuinely blocked
  (needs user). **A live backlog candidate means the run is NOT done — pivot to it.**
  **Safe background (ZERO orphans):** GPU concurrency is PLATFORM-SCOPED, re-derived at campaign
  start from the current model's memory footprint (26B-class → ONE job total; 4B/8B-class → one job
  PER GPU, pair candidate+control across the two 4090Ds — an idle second GPU during a training
  campaign is a bug, see §4 lesson 10) — `nvidia-smi` BEFORE dispatch, QUEUE don't collide. **EVERY long job MUST be TRACKED — no
  fire-and-forget:** prefer harness `run_in_background` (auto re-invokes on completion — ONE clean signal, no polling); a `setsid`-detached
  job is allowed ONLY if it writes a PID-file AND a RUNLOG registry line (cmd / PID / **cwd** / **start-time** /
  budget) AND arms a **`Monitor`** (a condition-watch → ONE clean notification when the job exits) — detach without all three is FORBIDDEN.
  **★ WAIT / PARK DISCIPLINE (2026-07-03 lesson — the Stop-hook re-fire loop):** to wait on a LOCAL condition
  (training/eval done, a file appears) → hang a **`Monitor`** or a Bash `run_in_background` wait — ONE clean
  notification at the condition. **NEVER a `ScheduleWakeup` poll: a timed wakeup that re-checks under an active
  Stop-hook re-fires the loop = the churn.** Browser→Pro waits → quiet **15-min** checks (never busy-poll). To
  **PARK / suspend** a run between steps → arm a `Monitor` and stop; do NOT idle-loop or schedule a re-poll.
  **★ THE SINGLE OWNERSHIP TEST (live-checkable; goal-directive + §4 lesson #5 reference THIS):** a process is
  **PROVABLY OURS** iff *(live) its cwd is under the project / `.claude/worktrees/` AND its cmd matches our job
  patterns*. A registry/PID-file entry only says WHICH PID to look at — **it NEVER proves ownership and NEVER
  authorizes a kill by itself.** A process owned by another project/user or with cwd OUTSIDE the project is the
  USER's own concurrent work (co-tenant, e.g. `JasonF/openpi` pi0, `gaussian-splatting` 3dgs; parent=systemd,
  cwd outside huggingface) → busy-GPU, QUEUE/wait, NEVER kill. **Unsure → WAIT, do not kill.**
  **★ PID-REUSE GUARD — a recorded PID NEVER authorizes a kill.** PIDs recycle: a stale PID-file may now point
  at an unrelated process (even a co-tenant). Before ANY `kill`, RE-VERIFY the LIVE process at that PID against
  the registry — its **cmd + cwd + start-time must ALL match** — AND it must pass the ownership test above. On
  any mismatch → the PID was recycled → do NOT kill; just clear the stale registry line.
  **Kill = ownership AND live re-verify AND a trigger:** (a) ON RESUME orphan-sweep — reconcile registry vs
  `ps`/`nvidia-smi`; adopt tracked jobs; kill only if owned + re-verified + stale-per-registry. (b) Overrun —
  kill our job (owned + re-verified) when it exceeds budget / >30min zero-output; clear the registry line.

## 3. Document conventions (the anti-drift contract)
| Artifact | Role | Cadence |
|---|---|---|
| `.claude/CLAUDE.md` | LEAN config: identity, engine routing, keys, hard rules, POINTERS | rarely |
| `plan/README.md` | **one-screen flow map** (the v0.5 loop) + plan/ doc index — START HERE | when structure changes |
| `plan/operating-manual.md` (this) | how-we-work reference (engines, Arbor, conventions, lessons, science kernel, §5 types+commands) | when process changes |
| `plan/goal-directive.md` | the exact `/goal` input (written by the user) | when goal changes |
| **research-os plugin** (`/home/lingxufeng/cli/research-os`) | the 7 commands + skills + `taste.md` + `research-types.md` — the canonical prompt layer | when the method changes |
| `plan/research-operating-system.md` | HISTORY: the v0.4 gate design + its diagnosis — superseded by research-os v0.5 | archive-grade reference |
| `plan/dspark-deep-analysis-2026-07-01.md` | DSpark technical breakdown + occupancy scan | when occupancy changes |
| `DSpark-analysis.md` | DSpark core ideas + transferable concepts | reference |
| `enrich.md` | the methodology schools + the MOS aesthetic (extended by the plugin's `taste.md`) | reference |
| **Arbor MCP tree** (`tree_view`) | **canonical STRUCTURE** — branches / status / result / insight / prune | **EVERY 验收, FIRST** |
| `plan/archive/` | CLOSED dLLM campaign + all prior experiment docs (do NOT load for DSpark work) | — |
> **The #1 process bug to never repeat:** updating the RUNLOG but not the tree → the tree goes stale and the
> research looks linear. Tree first, every cycle.

## 4. Hard-won lessons
1. **Substrate integrity.** Verify model/checkpoint integrity before trusting any metric. Ground-truth with a
   trivial task before committing compute. (Learned from a corrupted shard in the dLLM campaign — `plan/archive/`.)
2. **Metric validity.** Proxy metrics (loss, teacher-forced scores) often do NOT predict task quality. → Use
   **end-to-end generation / verifier metrics** as the primary signal.
3. **Failure-mode first.** Profile WHERE the model fails (generation-based) before designing a method.
4. **Tree discipline** (see §3). **Independent review** is mandatory (the Codex hook audits every executor
   diff); the proposer never self-grants `CLAIM_STANDS` — DOWN verdicts only.
5. Kill hung/overrunning jobs immediately — but ONLY a job that passes the §2 **ownership test** (live cwd
   under the project / `.claude/worktrees/` AND cmd matches our job patterns) AND the §2 **PID-reuse re-verify**
   (the live cmd + cwd + start-time all match the registry). **A recorded PID alone NEVER authorizes a kill**
   (PIDs recycle). **NEVER kill the user's concurrent co-tenant work** (e.g. `JasonF/openpi` pi0,
   `gaussian-splatting` 3dgs; cwd outside huggingface, parent=systemd) — when ownership is unsure, WAIT, don't
   kill. Measure-first (timing probe before heavy compute); only one 26B fits on the 2×4090 (serialize GPU
   jobs; `nvidia-smi` before dispatch); keep Playwright alive; **never modify sealed eval/test/baselines**.
6. **Subagent-dispatch discipline (perf — 2026-06-30, `subagent-dispatch-slowness` memory).** Heavy
   subagent-dense work is abnormally slow: per-turn latency scales with (context size × concurrency). →
   **Do small/clear tasks yourself** (a few-min direct edit beats a 30–50 min executor); **leaner prompts /
   less context per agent**; **serialize heavy agents — never 3–4 concurrent Opus subagents** (they
   rate-limit each other); **serialize heavy executors** (Sonnet 5 retired as unstable; executors now Opus 4.8). **The manual-`/codex:rescue`
   zombie-leak is RESOLVED — manual rescue is retired; the single managed Codex review hook (one dispatch per
   subagent, reaped at 30 min, registry-capped) replaces the leaky fan-outs.** GPU idle ≠ progress lost.
7. **The v0.4 framework lessons (2026-07-01 diagnosis — why the gates were rebuilt).** (a) Filters don't
   create value — problem selection does; (b) a gate-heavy system selects for gateable work → eval/certificate
   drift; (c) novelty gates must never judge improvement (刷分) work — occupancy is a cost signal, not a veto;
   (d) candidate MENUS exhaust — backlogs must regenerate from failures; (e) progress tokens are farmable by
   orderly retreat — count SURPRISES (plan-changes) instead; (f) process work is never the deliverable
   (>20% sustained = compass flag).
8. **★ ARTIFACT-FIDELITY (2026-07-02, DSpark archive audit — the most serious incident to date).** Every
   number in a shipped/banked document (report, README, tree result, memory) is READ FROM ITS ARTIFACT
   FILE at writing time, with the artifact path cited next to the table — NEVER recalled from working
   memory. The DSpark public archive shipped back-computed baselines, a wrong probe-model name, a
   cross-contaminated TV figure, and a "94% E[τ] ceiling" whose probe was never run (all corrected
   2026-07-02). A planned-but-unexecuted probe's numbers are NOT results. **Any push to a public remote
   REQUIRES `/artifact-acceptance` first, and its checklist includes: recompute each number from its
   cited source file — mismatch = HOLD.** (Full autopsy: `plan/retrospective-workflow-audit-2026-07-02.md`.)
9. **★ LAUNCH ARITHMETIC + CHEAP-SIGNAL LADDER (2026-07-02).** Before ANY training launch, inside the
   `/prereg` (or, for exploratory runs, a 3-line note): (a) measured sec/step × total steps = ETA — ETA
   over the §2 cap (≤3h dev / ≤12h sealed) ⇒ redesign, never launch; (b) data-sufficiency ratio vs the
   reference recipe (4.5K vs DSpark's ~500K = 100× short — one division would have predicted the
   from-scratch failure); (c) a declared KILL-CHECKPOINT {step, threshold, action=KILL} — a checkpoint
   eval below threshold kills the run, and a RESUME FAILURE IS A STOP, never a silent restart-from-0;
   **ENFORCED, not declared: at launch ARM A MONITOR on the run log** (`grep -E` covering progress ·
   kill-threshold cross · `Traceback|resume-failed|OOM|Killed`) so the kill-checkpoint fires the moment it
   trips — even after attention has moved on (the DSpark step-500 signal was ignored because nothing was
   watching). Agent-armed per-run = zero conflict with the global hook stack; NO blocking PreToolUse hook.
   Design + the >30-min launch ritual: `plan/workflow-enforcement-design-2026-07-02.md`.
   (d) never retrain what a released checkpoint already provides (the vanilla-retrain waste). LADDER:
   for head/method work the forge KILL experiment defaults to an inference-time replay / oracle probe
   when one exists — no training run before its oracle-replay upper bound is measured (the skipped
   Probe C would have sized the RSMH prize at zero training cost).
10. **GPU throughput defaults (2026-07-02).** Generation-heavy steps (data regen, sampling evals) use
   vLLM / batched generation, never unbatched HF `.generate()` (observed 0.1 samples/s, a ~20-50×
   waste); measure samples/s in the first minute and abort if ETA > budget. Small-model campaigns keep
   BOTH GPUs busy (candidate + control / next candidate in parallel).

## 5. Science protocol (the kernel) + research-os v0.5
Falsify-before-build (ship the kill-experiment WITH the idea) · score-up ≠ mechanism (require negative control
+ locality) · eval/test/baseline are a **sealed layer, never changed mid-run** · one variable per probe ·
isolation: **generator ≠ executor ≠ critic** (Opus generates/selects; executor subagents run in worktrees; the
Codex hook audits every diff; Pro designs/arbitrates) · **experiment has absolute veto over elegance** · every
claim-bearing run pre-declares its contract (`/prereg`) · when evidence contradicts the direction, **redesign
the program**, don't defend it. A negative result is a SUCCESS **iff its autopsy generated something**.

> **★ SUBSTRATE NOTE (applies to ALL of §5).** An "INDEPENDENT substrate" = the **automatic Codex review
> hook** (SubagentStop, advisory, uncurated, un-re-rollable), a dispatched fresh-context reviewer, or
> **GPT-5.5 Pro** — never the proposer. Independence grants DOWN bindingly and UP only through an actual
> pass (`CLAIM_STANDS`); **silence ≠ pass**; contribution/paper promotion = human only.

### 5.0 Research TYPES — name the type FIRST, verify by type
> Full taxonomy: research-os `skills/prospect/references/research-types.md`. Schools (enrich.md) = how to
> think; TYPES = what kind of output + how it is valued + verified. The v0.4 bug was type-blindness:
> novelty gates killed improvement work; gate pressure herded output toward evaluation certificates.

| Type | Value = | Verify | Characteristic failure |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Improvement 刷分/改进** | measured Δ vs honestly-tuned baseline; idea novelty IRRELEVANT | `/adversary` A+B (Δ-reality + baseline fairness). Occupancy = "has this EXACT change been measured here", never "does anyone work here" | unfair baseline; occupancy-as-veto |
| **Evaluation 评估** | a DECISION that changes because of the measurement | name the changed decision — no decision-change = certificate | certificate-production (audit theater) — the loop's most seductive failure |
| **Survey 综述** | a map that changes where people search + a mined PROBLEM LIST (surveys are a `/prospect` mine, not a reading assignment) | ≥1 problem someone would drop their work to attack | summarizing instead of mining |
| **Novelty 新对象** | a reframe that explains old failures AND predicts new ones (enrich MOS) | differential prediction where it applies (optional `/prereg` DPC block) | cosmetic relabel |
| **Systems 系统** | end-to-end wall-clock/cost lever at equal quality | end-to-end, never proxy | proxy wins, e2e loses |
| **Negative 证伪** | a killed assumption the community builds on | scope honesty; structural = independent-only | strawman; scope inflation |
| **Theory 理论** | many phenomena → one mechanism + ≥1 NEW prediction | the prediction, tested | post-hoc unification |
| **Tooling 工具** | an experiment class others can now run — and DO | used in anger within one cycle | infra for its own sake (v0.4's own disease) |
| **Reproduction 复现** | trust recalibration on a LOAD-BEARING result | pre-stated deltas + sealed protocol | reproducing the peripheral |

**Type-drift is the canonical loop failure** (`/compass` check 1): goal says design/improvement, artifacts
trend evaluation-shaped (certificates/audits/probes). Detect structurally — type the last 3–5 artifacts.

### 5.1 The three discipline moments + the one invariant (the filter, collapsed)
> Most work never sees a gate: plumbing, exploration, tactical runs flow freely. Discipline binds at
> exactly THREE moments. One question replaces the old lane table: **"is this a claim leaving the loop?"**
> yes → `/adversary`; no → just go.

| Moment | Command | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Before a claim-bearing run** | **`/prereg`** | freeze {HYPOTHESIS, MECHANISM, TYPE, METRIC, sealed SPLIT, ACCEPT-if, KILL-if, NEG-CONTROL, SEEDS ≥3, ONE-VAR} in 10–20 lines, via Arbor. Post-hoc edits void the run as evidence. **Exploration is free** — contract only what will be cited. Optional DPC block for novelty claims. |
| **After any run** | **`/exp-verify`** | 3-stage real-run check: no-mock → executed-on-real-data → **anti-no-op** (the intervention provably FIRED). A no-op FAILS even if the metric improved. VERIFIED = real run, not real effect. |
| **At the claim boundary ONLY** | **`/adversary`** | ONE independent pass, TYPE-scoped: **A** Δ-reality (≥3 seeds mean±std, per-example regression, neg-control, sealed holdout) · **B** baseline fairness (make the OPPOSING baseline win — equal budget, paired stats 5×2CV/McNemar/DeLong) · **C** claim–evidence map (no artifact ⇒ auto-downgrade to hypothesis; new-metric-as-evidence GUILTY until it corrects a misleading eval; structural-negative needs the 3-part gate) · **D** worth check (toy? goalpost-moved? He-bar graded TYPE-relative; eval claims must name the changed decision). |

**THE ONE INVARIANT (unchanged from v0.4 — the piece that was correct):** *a verdict that helps the
proposer if gamed must never be granted by the proposer.* Proposer self-administers **DOWN only**
(`REFUTED` / `DOWNGRADED_TO_HYPOTHESIS` / `TOY` / kill / `scoped-negative`). **`CLAIM_STANDS` = independent
substrate only** (fresh uncurated context; a failed pass is ANSWERED point-by-point, never re-rolled).
**Contribution / paper promotion = human only**; an AI `CLAIM_STANDS` is advisory input to that decision.

**Autonomy boundary** (unchanged): MAY unilaterally — observe · prospect · forge · prereg · dispatch
worktree executors · run dev/sealed eval under frozen contracts · autopsy · update tree/RUNLOG · kill its
own toys. MAY NOT — change the success metric after seeing results · broaden scope · self-grant
`CLAIM_STANDS` · promote to contribution. The human is a RARE escalation, not a per-cycle bottleneck.

### 5.2 The GENERATOR — /prospect · /forge · /autopsy (+ /compass) — the enrich layer, operationalized
> This is what v0.4 lacked: of 10 gates, zero generated. Research quality is decided at problem-selection
> time; these commands are where taste acts GENERATIVELY (ranking and shaping), not as a filter.
> Foundations: research-os `skills/forge/references/taste.md` (the taste model — extends enrich.md) +
> `references/schools.md` (the 14-school palette + the 10-question generator).

| Command | Fires | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **`/prospect`** | goal start · compass "no surprises" · region-close lateral · any fresh corpus | Hunt problems through the FIVE MINES: ① literature/survey 综述 (contradictions between papers · silently-shared assumptions · future-work graveyards · missing head-to-heads · stale numbers predating a capability shift) ② own logs (anomalies, seed variance, baseline misbehavior — the cheapest original problems) ③ capability deltas ("X was designed under constraint C; C just disappeared") ④ benchmark critique ⑤ cross-domain transplants (transplant the precondition, not the buzzword). Output: 3–7 ranked problem cards `{Q, TYPE, WHY-NOW, STAKES, PROBE, SURPRISE}`. Discard: gap-filling without a WHY-EMPTY answer; no-stakes problems; gate-shaped (easy-to-verify) problems. |
| **`/forge`** | one problem chosen | Name the load-bearing variable → type-scoped occupancy re-pricing (≤15 min, NEVER a veto) → generate 3–5 candidates via the schools palette (**+1 rival school, always**; the MOS move is ONE move, used when the failure signature smells like a wrong object) → each card `{MECHANISM one-sentence-why, KILL cheapest-falsifier, COST, SURPRISE}` → taste-rank → He-bar in GENERATIVE mode ("what would make this beautiful?" — 5 real min simplifying) → **the REGENERATION RULE** (which failure promotes which candidate — the anti-menu clause) → **route the candidate DESIGN to Pro by DEFAULT** (Pro designs the architecture, Opus only tunes; skip only for tactical tuning of an already-Pro-designed arch, with a written reason — the fix for "the loop never uses Pro though Pro is better"). |
| **`/autopsy`** | every null / kill / DOWN verdict | Boring-first (bug/data/config — most negatives are bugs; fix, bank nothing) → mechanism-level why (which link of the MECHANISM sentence broke) → DOWN-only scope grade (structural = independent-only) → **THE CONVERSION LAW: emit ≥1 of (a) a CONSTRAINT (re-prices the backlog), (b) a CANDIDATE (run the regeneration rule; 10-question the RESULT), (c) a REGION-CLOSE (→ lateral `/prospect`). None ⇒ the autopsy is incomplete.** Tree FIRST, then RUNLOG, then backlog update. |
| **`/compass`** | **after every 2nd `/autopsy`** (a countable trigger — "every 3–5 cycles" never fired in the DSpark campaign) · stuck · before an expensive leg | ① TYPE-DRIFT (type the last 3–5 artifacts vs the goal's declared type — the eval-drift detector; on flag, name the next ON-type artifact) ② SURPRISE ACCOUNTING (which observation changed the plan? zero = farming process → force a generator move) ③ PROGRAMME HEALTH (Lakatos as questions: hard core intact? heuristic still generating? predicting or absorbing?) ④ PROCESS BUDGET (workflow >20% sustained → ship a run). Verdict: CONTINUE / REFRAME / LATERAL / STOP_AND_REPORT — advisory; redirects, never blocks. |

> `/compass` check 5 flags frame- AND operator-monoculture. **Four axes: schools · types · frames ·
> operators — the ceiling.**

**The loop:** `/prospect` → `/forge` → `/prereg` → *(big/committing run? `/irreversible-decision-audit` first
→ cheap probe)* → run → `/exp-verify` → (claim → `/adversary` → human if contribution · null → `/autopsy` →
back into the backlog) · `/compass` **after every 2nd `/autopsy`** (§5.2). Layer-2 (§5.4) fires at high-stakes only:
`/epistemic-calibration` before promoting a novelty/occupancy claim, `/artifact-acceptance` at a handoff.

### 5.3 ★ ARBOR IS THE SUBSTRATE — write STRUCTURE through the MCP, not md/json
> **Arbor MCP is the canonical store and the execution substrate.** Every command PERSISTS its structural
> output through Arbor; md/json is reduced to the few sealed contracts a fixed-field node cannot hold.
> The tree is the source of truth; RUNLOG is secondary narrative (or `generate_report`).

Arbor node fields = `hypothesis · status · result · insight · score · test_score · code_ref`; session meta =
`eval_cmd/eval_cmd_test · baseline/trunk_score · metric_direction`. The write-through map:

| Loop point | Arbor MCP (PRIMARY) | sealed artifact (`node.code_ref` → it) |
|---|---|---|
| `/prospect` cards | `tree_add_node(hypothesis=card, status=pending)` | — |
| `/forge` choice + backlog | `tree_update_node(status=in_progress)`; backlog + regeneration rule in insight | — |
| `/prereg` contract | `tree_set_meta(eval_cmd, eval_cmd_test, baseline_score, metric_direction)` | the 10-field contract file (timestamped) |
| DISPATCH isolation | `worktree_create` / `worktree_remove` | the contract + exact inputs (no ambient dump) |
| run + score | **`eval_run(cmd, split=dev\|test, node_id, set_meta)`** | `/exp-verify` verdict = node insight |
| claim boundary | `tree_update_node(result, insight)` | `/adversary` per-check evidence |
| null / kill | `tree_prune(reason)` + `tree_update_node(insight=conversion-law output)` | — |
| merge / promote | **`git_merge_branch`** (already a no-regression gate) | human promotion record |
| programme pulse | append to programme node insight | `/compass` verdict paragraph |
| the narrative | `generate_report` | — |

**Rule:** if Arbor has a tool/field for it, USE IT (don't re-implement in md/json).

### 5.4 Layer-2 wrap (optional, high-stakes — research-os v0.6)
> Three wrap skills around the core loop, fired ONLY at high-stakes moments (never every cycle). Each adds a
> decision boundary the core 7 do not gate; none duplicates them. Distilled from a Fable 5 methodology audit
> (archived: `plan/archive/fable5-methodology-extraction-2026-07-01/`).

| Command | Fires | Boundary it adds |
|---|---|---|
| **`/epistemic-calibration`** | before promoting/citing/contracting a claim, or spending compute/reputation | grade evidence **A–E**: A/B decide · C HOLD · D (memory/taste) can't-promote · E escalate. The novelty-by-memory + overclaiming guard; a grade-D "this is novel" → HOLD + live search, never a contracted claim. |
| **`/irreversible-decision-audit`** | before a committing step (benchmark/story/method/big-run/public-claim) | detect the lock (narrative/benchmark/method/evidence/compute/reputation/product) → **PROCEED/DELAY/RESCOPE/BLOCK** + a reversible substitute. This is the DETECTOR for the "external/irreversible commitment → human" boundary; DSpark default = a full run before the ceiling-probe → DELAY/BLOCK. |
| **`/artifact-acceptance`** | at a share/reuse/handoff of a deliverable (report/README/demo/skill) | is it usable by another person → **SHIP/REVISE/HOLD/KILL** (distinct from `/adversary`'s claim-truth). External SHIP still routes through the human promotion gate. |

Same invariant: proposer self-administers only DOWN verdicts; escalation → independent substrate (contested)
or human (external). The audit's `agent-governance` was NOT added as a skill (it IS the invariant + the
engine division); its two sharp bits — the **cold-start review packet** and the **agreement-illusion guard**
(stance-separated, REFUTE-prompted review) — are folded into `/adversary`.

## 6. Arbor command routing & tree discipline
> A **pragmatic hybrid**: Arbor's tree for STRUCTURE, research-os for DECISIONS, multi-engine for REVIEW.
> We do NOT adopt the full Arbor skill suite (built for unattended full-auto; ours is human-in-the-loop
> goal mode).

### 6.1 Ideation layering (pick by altitude)
| Layer | Weight | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| **`/prospect` + `/forge`** (research-os) | HEAVY — the generator; may escalate to Pro | **DIRECTION-level**: goal start, a new problem, a fork after a region-close. Output = ranked problem cards / a live candidate backlog. |
| **arbor-agent-ideate** | LIGHT — single-engine, 4-line `tree_add_node`, in-loop | **TACTICAL in-loop**: draft the next node under an active candidate, a quick variant. Output = one tree node. |
> Heuristic: does it change the programme / need the external brain? → `/prospect`+`/forge`. Is it "the
> next experiment under this candidate"? → arbor-agent-ideate (or plain Opus-propose, disciplined by the
> Codex hook).

### 6.2 Tree-update checklist (fixes the #1 process bug — loose tree discipline)
At EVERY 验收, tree FIRST then RUNLOG:
- [ ] `tree_update_node` the dispatched node — status (done/pruned/in_progress) + result + insight
      (for a null: the `/autopsy` conversion-law output IS the insight).
- [ ] new candidate → `tree_add_node` BEFORE dispatch · dead branch → `tree_prune` + reason.
- [ ] node types = {idea, experiment, negative, `programme`}. A `programme` node is created only after a
      candidate survives its first claim boundary + human budget approval; its health is checked by
      `/compass` (questions, not scores).
- [ ] new track/eval at INIT → `tree_set_meta` the eval contract (B_dev/B_test, metric, metric_direction).
- [ ] **direction/campaign CLOSE → close-out sweep**: reconcile ALL descendant node statuses (no
      dangling in_progress/pending under a closed node) + purge any number lacking an artifact from
      tree/memory before it can propagate into reports (the phantom-E[τ] lesson, §4.8).
- [ ] THEN append the RUNLOG narrative.

### 6.3 Arbor commands: use / skip / adopt-later
| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| `tree_view/add/update/prune` · peer-review-gate · arbor-agent-ideate | **USED** |
| novelty (`arbor-agent-search`) | covered by Pro 扩展 |
| setup-intake / coordinator | covered by `goal-directive.md` + goal mode |
| `arbor-agent-tools` (emulation layer) | N/A — we have the native MCP tools |
| research-agent / orchestrator (full-auto loop) | **deliberately NOT used** — goal mode fits human-in-loop |
| **`tree_set_meta`+`eval_run`+`git_merge_branch`** (merge-eval automation) | **ADOPT NOW** — `eval_run` writes scores into the tree from the actual command output, which is the structural antidote to write-from-memory number drift (§4.8; the deferral was load-bearing in the DSpark archive incident). |
| executor `RunTraining` + resume/checkpoint | consider for long training runs. |

### 6.4 Isolation discipline (kernel ⑥)
`/prospect`/`/forge` propose (Opus). A **routine tactical selection** (which backlog candidate to run) is
Opus's own call — a resource choice inside the autonomy boundary, disciplined by the KILL side of
`/adversary`/`/autopsy` and the **Codex hook** that independently audits the resulting work. A
**consequential direction / thesis selection** routes to an independent read (**GPT-5.5 Pro**, Playwright).
The anti-self-love discipline = DOWN-only self-verdicts + the automatic hook, not a mandatory pre-work
review call.
